    <p> Thriller is one of my favorite genres to watch. I love the suspense and thrill (no pun intended) it brings. However, I did not love this movie as much as I hoped. The plot line itself wasn't too bad, but the tropes of the movie weren't the best. Parker (played by Emma) is Dan's (Kevin) girlfriend and she intrudes on him and Joe's (Austin) boys trip. Joe and Parker don't really get along, which isn't my favorite conflict to watch because it's overused. Parker is kind of the "ditzy" girlfriend, which is really cringy especially because it's 2021 now. However, I'll cut the director some slack since this movie was from 2010 and times were different back then. Some parts of the movie felt like "Of course this happens," and played on the idea of "It can't possibly get worse" but then gets worse. I'm not into those types of movies because it's so cliche. One thing I think they did well was the horror aspect. I won't reveal too much, but it did make me squeamish!</p>
    <p>If you're simply looking for gruesome scenes, I'd recommend it, but otherwise you wouldn't be missing too much if you skip this.</p>

    <p> My favorite part of the movie was the one where Dan was about to be eaten by wolves, but his main concern was making sure that Parker didn't see what was happening - such an angsty moment, which I love. Seeing the wolves though, did make me think "Of course there's wolves," because it was one  of those predictable scenes that intend to add suspense but really causes an eyeroll. Both Joe's and Dan's deaths were tragic; Dan's because of his last words, and Joe's because we had more hope that he would survive. I'm glad that Parker survives in the end though. </p>
