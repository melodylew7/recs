    <p> I'm usually not a big fan of romance movies because they can get sooo cheesy, but this one definitely made me reevaluate my stance on them! I absolutely loved this movie, from the Asian-American cast to the plot - everything. The plot from the blurb sounds cliche (old lovers reuniting is kind of basic), but Randall Park and Ali Wong executed it amazingly. I love Park's humour; I've seen him in the Asian-American TV show Fresh Off the Boat, which is hilarious by the way. His comedy is also seen in ABMM, which I suppose made it different from the typical romance movies. Sasha is an admirable character, one who is headstrong, successful, and independent. Hate to admit it, but her stubbornness to accept Marcus back into her life - spoiler alert: she does - is something I can relate to. Her food also looks bomb so you might get hungry watching - grab a snack beforehand! </p>
    <p>If you're looking for a funny, wholesome movie to watch, even if you aren't a big fan of romance, definitely give this one a go!</p>

    <p> My favorite part of the movie was the end where Sasha opens up her own restaurant and it's all of Marcus's late mom's cuisines that she taught Sasha how to make. She even named the restaurant after her!! It was a great way to end the movie, too, not cliche or expected. When Marcus goes to win Sasha back at the Food Gallery Award Show, his speech was cheesy, yes, but not to the point where I cringed. He added his own flair to it, which made it more bearable. Another memorable moment was the special appearance of Keanu Reeves. His slight jabs at Marcus were so funny, and the way Sasha brushed them off made it even funnier because it's Keanu Reeves!! Overall, great movie :D </p>
